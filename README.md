MemorySharp - Original Author: Jämes Ménétrey aka ZenLulz.
===================

Hello,

I I really liked the MemorySharp library by ZenLulz. Sadly, it did not contain some items I wanted in a memory library as I started getting more and more into it since I started. Instead of simply use a different library, 

I decided to just work on adding the features in myself. No exes, or dlls are included. You must restore the packages and then compile if you want. For now, I do not intend to release binary's until it is more stable. 

One main feature added was support for people running injected code. A basic WndProc hook, curtiosy of jadds blog: http://blog.ntoskr.nl/hooking-threads-without-detours-or-patches/ , unsafe code reads, etc.

**

Some documentation of new features by example.
-----------------------------

* Pattern scanning examples.

```csharp
   // Our memory sharp instance for the pattern scanning examples below.
            var sharp = new MemorySharp(ApplicationFinder.FromProcessName("ProcessName").First());

            // Standard pattern scan from byte/mask pattern and log the scan result values to all valid log instances. 
            var scanResult1 = sharp.Patterns.Find(new byte[] {4, 4, 00, 0xC}, "XX?X", 4, false);
            LogManager.Instance.LogInfo(scanResult1.Address + " " + scanResult1.Offset + " " + scanResult1.OriginalAddress);

            // Dword text-based pattern scan from and log the scan result values to all valid log instances.
            var scanResult2 = sharp.Patterns.Find("55 8b ec 51 FF 05 ?? ?? ?? ?? A1", 0xC, false);
            LogManager.Instance.LogInfo(scanResult2.Address + " " + scanResult2.Offset + " " + scanResult2.OriginalAddress);

            // byte[] array based pattern scan from and log the scan result values to all valid log instances.
            var scanResult3 = sharp.Patterns.Find(new byte[] { 4, 4, 00, 0xC }, 0xC, false);
            LogManager.Instance.LogInfo(scanResult3.Address + " " + scanResult3.Offset + " " + scanResult3.OriginalAddress);

            // Now we will use files to add pattern scan results to a Dictionary.

            // Our patterns to create our json file with.
            var pattern = new SerializablePattern
            {
                Description = "ExamplePattern",
                TextPattern = "55 8b ec 51 FF 05 ?? ?? ?? ?? A1",
                OffsetToAdd = 0,
                RebaseResult = false,
                Comments = "This comment is useful when the pattern is stored in a xml or json file."
            };

            var pattern2 = new SerializablePattern
            {
                Description = "ExamplePattern2",
                TextPattern = "55 8b ?? a1 ?? ?? ?? ?? 56 57 8d ?? ?? ??",
                OffsetToAdd = 0,
                RebaseResult = false,
                Comments = "This comment is useful when the pattern is stored in a xml or json file."
            };
            // Save the objects to a json file as an array so they can be serialized later.
            JsonHelper.ExportToFile(new[] {pattern,pattern2}, "Patterns.json");
            // Now in your app folder, there should be a Patterns.json file. We can scan our results for this pattern from this file from now on.
            // This is the dictonary instance we will add the results to.
            var patternResults = new Dictionary<string, IntPtr>();
            sharp.Patterns.CollectJsonScanResults("Patterns.json", patternResults);
            // Now print the pointers found from the pattern scan, using the description of the pattern as the key.
            Console.WriteLine(patternResults["ExamplePattern"].ToString("X"));
            Console.WriteLine(patternResults["ExamplePattern2"].ToString("X"));

            // You can also save all the results to a text file in a format you can copy and paste into a class for static pointers instances.
           sharp.Patterns.LogScanResultsToFile("Patterns.json", PatternFileType.Json);
           // The text file produced should contain the following:
           // public static IntPtr ExamplePattern { get; } = (IntPtr)0x000;
           // public static IntPtr ExamplePattern2 { get; } = (IntPtr)0x000
           ```
Injected Support added.
-----------------------

Hook WndProc and pass your own call back engine easily:
```csharp
     public class HookEngine : IWindowEngine
        {
            public void StartUp() => WriteLine(@"Hi from process: " + GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName);
            public void ShutDown() => WriteLine(@"Bye from process: " + GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName);
        }
    
        public static class HookExample
        {
            private static IWindowEngine _windowEngine;
            private static WindowHook WindowHook { get; set; }
            public static void Attach()
            {
                // This is our custom engine we pass to the window hook class as a ref.
                _windowEngine = new HookEngine();
                // 0x500 should be the handle to the window being hooked. Should often just be the MainWindowHandle of the process.
                WindowHook = new WindowHook(new IntPtr(0x500),"WndProcHook",ref _windowEngine);
                WindowHook.Enable();
                // This should invoke our HookEngine start up method to run, printing a console message.
                WindowHook.SendUserMessage(UserMessage.StartUp);
            }
```
Using IntPtr Extensions for internal reading.
---------------------------------------------
```csharp
    public static class InjectedDelegatesReadWriteExamples
        {
            private static GetObjectLocation InternalGetObjectLocation { get; set; }

            // Read/Write memory with IntPtr extensions while injected.
            public static void PrintAndWriteAddresS()
            {
                var pointer = new IntPtr(0x500).Read<IntPtr>();
                Console.WriteLine(pointer.ToString("X"));
                // Write to it.
                pointer.WriteBytes(new byte[] {1, 2, 3});
                pointer.WriteString("Hi", Encoding.UTF8);
                pointer.Write("Use a type of object here, not a string. Use write string for that.");
            }

            // Use delegates with extensions easier. This is the delegate.
            [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.ThisCall)]
            private delegate void GetObjectLocation(IntPtr objectPointer, out Vector3 location3D);
            // Register it.
            public static void RegisterGetObjectLocationDelegate() => InternalGetObjectLocation = new IntPtr(0x500).ToDelegate<GetObjectLocation>();
            // Using it.
            public static Vector3 MyLocation
            {
                get
                {
                    Vector3 myVector3;
                    InternalGetObjectLocation(new IntPtr(0x500), out myVector3);
                    return myVector3;
                }
            }
        }
```
Tools, logging, updaters, misc features added examples.
---------------------------------------------

* Updaters (thanks to Zatt @ unknowncheats and aganonki as well from there).


```csharp
    // Credits: Zatt @ unknowncheats.me
    public class MyUpdaterExample
    {
        // 2500 Interval updater.
        private static ThreadedUpdater Updater { get; } = new ThreadedUpdater("ExampleConsoleWriter", 2500);
        
       public static void StartUpdating()
            {
                Updater.Enable();
                // Console should get lines every 2500 ms now.
                Thread.Sleep(5000);
                // Turn it off now.
                Updater.Disable();
            }

            private void Updater_OnUpdate(object sender, ThreadedUpdater.DeltaEventArgs e)
            {
               Console.WriteLine("Hi, we were called.");
            }
        }
```
3D Math (Credits: Zatt).
------------------------
* WorldToScreen
 
```csharp
        public static Vector2 GetWorldToScreen(Matrix viewMatrix, Vector2 vector2, Vector3 vector3)
            {
               return viewMatrix.WorldToScreen(vector2, vector3);
            }
```   
      
 
 * Distance to.            
```csharp
public static float DistanceTo(Vector2 vector2One, Vector2 vector2Two)
 {
  return vector2One.DistanceTo(vector2Two);
 }
```

Torpedos @ ownedcore.
Replied to lots of noob questions, gave me very solid tips in terms of going about learning and using code in relation to game hacking.


Corthezz @ ownedcore. 
Good blog for starters who are stuck in external land or have not messed with assembly calling of functions or what ever much yet.,

LordTerror @ Unknown.
A friend who helped me understand hacking concepts a LOT. I do not think he uses forums these days at all, but might have some old good reads if you google around.
