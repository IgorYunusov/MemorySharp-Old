# MemorySharp
A version of ZenLulz MemorySharp with some misc changes.

Hello,

This is a modifed version of the really neat MemorySharp lib. The authors website can be found here, and should get full credits. http://binarysharp.com/

This version has a few basic changes/features added:

-Pattern scanning that supports several formats and xml file pattern scanning to a dictonary.
-In-process read/write/delegate methods added.
-RemoteCall class to make the already stupid-easy asm injection easier.
-Default 'isRelative' param is now false.
-Misc changes. Will add later.
